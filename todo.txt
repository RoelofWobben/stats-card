Changes needed 

    min-height not height 100vh on body
    no width or min-height on the component (.container)
    max-width on the component in rem (this will need to be different for mobile and desktop)
    width 50% on .image and .text only applied in the media query for larger screens
    add the role="list" to the ul and `role="listitem" to each li
    remove padding from the ul
    move the container margin to the default styles not in the media query so it always has that margin
    remove paddings off h1 and paragraph. They have no concept of 'internal' space, they are not boxes. They should only need vertical margins
    change the media query definition to (a) start earlier and (b) be defined in rem or em, not pixels. There is room for the larger screen layout earlier than 1150px wide
    you may need to reduce the padding inside .text on desktop as it's really big
